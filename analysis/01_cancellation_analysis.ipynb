This disparity suggests a lower level of commitment from third-party intermediaries compared to **Direct** or **Corporate** bookings, which maintain much healthier margins below 15%. To stabilize revenue, the hotel should consider implementing non-refundable deposits or stricter overbooking models specifically for these high-risk segments."
