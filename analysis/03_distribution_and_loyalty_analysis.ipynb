This indicates that leisure-oriented channels are key to reducing room turnover costs and maximizing occupancy per booking. In contrast, **Corporate Agreements** and **Global Distribution Systems (GDS)** show shorter averages (**2.25 and 1.70 nights** respectively), which aligns with the fast-paced nature of business travel. To optimize profitability, the hotel should design \"extended stay\" incentives specifically for these shorter-duration channels to increase their overall contribution to total room nights."

A significant portion of loyal customers continues to use **Agencies (26.53%)** or **Other channels (46.26%)**, which implies that the hotel is paying commissions for guests who are already familiar with the brand. This dependency on third parties for returning visitors erodes net profit. To increase the \"Direct Share,\" the hotel should implement a dedicated loyalty program that offers exclusive benefits—such as early check-in or better room rates—specifically for those who book through internal channels, effectively converting \"Other\" and \"Agency\" users into high-margin direct advocates."

This October spike suggests a successful response to specific regional events or seasonal festivities like Halloween. Furthermore, the steady growth observed from 2015 to 2017 indicates an increasing brand presence. To optimize revenue during lower-occupancy periods (such as early Q1 and late Q4), the hotel should implement targeted promotional campaigns and dynamic pricing strategies, leveraging the \"Halloween effect\" discovered in this analysis to boost off-season demand."
