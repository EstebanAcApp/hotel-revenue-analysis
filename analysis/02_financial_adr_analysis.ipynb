The **Resort Hotel** exhibits extreme seasonality, with prices peaking in **August at $182.10**, followed by a sharp decline to a minimum of **$48.96 in November**. Conversely, the **City Hotel** maintains a remarkably stable ADR throughout the year, suggesting a more consistent demand. To mitigate the resort's off-season revenue drop, it is recommended to implement aggressive marketing campaigns for Q4, targeting segments with flexible travel schedules or corporate events to improve occupancy during low-rate months."

This represents a substantial **54.98% premium** in daily revenue, which effectively offsets the higher operational costs and specialized amenities required for children. Given this significant margin, the hotel should prioritize marketing strategies and infrastructure investments—such as kids' clubs or family-oriented entertainment—to further attract this lucrative segment and maximize RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room)."

While segments like **Groups** and **Corporate** fall below this average, this often reflects pre-negotiated volume discounts rather than underpricing. Most notably, the **Complementary** segment sits **96.79% below** the global average at just **$3.28**; while expected for non-revenue bookings, its volume should be strictly monitored to avoid displacing high-value guests. For underperforming commercial segments, the hotel should review contract terms and focus on \"upselling\" additional services to compensate for the lower daily rates."
